Exploitation :
The first Step to Exploiting the program is to gain access to Mark's Pokemon. The simplest way to do that is to buffer overflow to change the UserIsMark boolean to True. This gives you access to all of Mark's data and information.
Once you have access, you must then delete Mark's Pokemon. There is a unused method names reset, which would delete all of Mark's saved pokemon. By overwritting the return pointer, you can redirect the program to run reset function, thus effectively deleteing all of Mark's Pokemon.
